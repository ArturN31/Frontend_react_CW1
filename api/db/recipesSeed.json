        "instructions": "Preheat oven to 425°F. Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard. With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears. Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt.With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt. Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them. They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning. They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.",

Prepare a sous vide immersion circulator for use according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Preheat the water to 122°F (50°C). Place the bags into the circulating water and cook for 40 minutes for medium doneness. 5 minutes before the salmon is done, stir fry the bean sprouts in a large pan with a tsp of sesame oil and a splash of soy sauce. Divide evenly in two plates. Once the salmon is done, sear the skin in the same pan for 30 seconds. Place each fillet on top of the bean sprouts and pour the saved sauce on it. Optionally, you can also use the sauce from the ziplock bags, but keep in mind it will be more watery (we did anyway).Garnish with the sliced spring onion and serve!",
